# ListBuddy App

## About
This is the repository for the front-end of *ListBuddy*.  

Run locally with `npm run dev`.

## Inspiration
We wanted to create an application that could help people with executive dysfunction with managing and completing tasks. People with this behavioral symptom may feel helpless when it comes to getting tasks done, leading them to shut down and not complete any tasks at all.

## What it does
ListBuddy will help you with creating, managing, and keeping track of completed tasks. You will start by creating an account so that ListBuddy can give you access to your tasks from anywhere. Then you will be brought to chat with ListBuddy casually about upcoming events you have and what you need to get done by then. ListBuddy will take what you've written and reply with a list of tasks catered to you. Your tasks will be split into "Active tasks" and "Completed tasks". When a task is completed, you can manually check it off your "Active tasks" list, when it will move to the "Completed tasks" and you will gain 1 star as a reward.

## How we built it
We used React and Tailwind to stylize our web application. OpenAI was used to allow ListBuddy to generate a list of tasks for the user.
